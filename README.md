# Crypto Price Tracker with Robust Testing Framework

This Python project serves as a foundational demonstration of frontend testing principles and best practices within the context of cryptocurrency price tracking. The core functionality involves fetching real-time cryptocurrency prices from the CoinGecko API and presenting them in a user-friendly format. However, the primary focus lies in establishing a comprehensive testing framework to guarantee the accuracy, reliability, and maintainability of the application, aligning with the high standards expected in professional software development, particularly in the fast-paced and ever-evolving cryptocurrency domain.

## Features

- **Real-time Price Retrieval:** Utilizes the CoinGecko API to fetch up-to-the-minute cryptocurrency prices.
- **Error Handling:** Implements robust error handling to gracefully manage scenarios such as invalid cryptocurrency symbols or API connectivity issues.
- **Unit Testing:** Leverages the `unittest` framework to conduct granular unit tests, verifying the correctness of individual functions and components.
- **Integration Testing:** Incorporates integration tests to assess the seamless interaction between different modules and external dependencies, ensuring the application functions as a cohesive whole.
- **Test Coverage:** Employs coverage analysis tools to measure the extent to which the codebase is exercised by the test suite, identifying areas requiring additional test cases.
- **Continuous Integration (CI) Readiness:** Designed to integrate seamlessly with CI pipelines, facilitating automated testing and deployment processes.
- **Scalability:** The modular architecture and adherence to best practices promote scalability, allowing for future enhancements and expansion of features.

- `tests/`: Houses the comprehensive test suite, organized into unit and integration test modules.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the project dependencies for streamlined installation.
- `README.md`: This comprehensive documentation file.

## Future Enhancements

- **Frontend Integration:** Develop a user interface (potentially using a web framework like Flask or Django) to provide a visually appealing and interactive experience.
- **Historical Data:** Incorporate historical price data and charting capabilities to enable users to visualize price trends over time.
- **Multiple Cryptocurrency Support:** Extend the functionality to track and display prices for a wider range of cryptocurrencies.
- **Portfolio Tracking:** Allow users to create and manage portfolios, calculating their total value based on real-time prices.
- **Advanced Testing:** Implement additional testing methodologies such as performance testing, security testing, and end-to-end testing to further enhance the robustness of the application.
